# Robot Calibration Deep Dives

**2D Robot Calibration**

This part of the project models a 2D robot with two rotary joints. 
The my_2d_robot package currently contains the urdf describing the 2D robot, the joint state publisher node, which publishes the state of the robot's rotary joints to the robot_state_publisher and the joint states subscriber node, and the joint states subscriber node which calculates the position of the end effetor and publishes the joints' states and end effector position to a.....(csv, yaml, json?) file.
